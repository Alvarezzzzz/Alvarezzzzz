<p>
	I am a computer engineering student, passionate about this world. I love learning every day and unraveling every facet to improve myself and expand my knowledge. Studying computer engineering, I also discovered another of my passions: mathematics, and that is why I also studied a bachelor's degree in pure mathematics. That is why I currently specialize in web development, but I continue learning about other areas since in the future I would like to work on interdisciplinary projects, such as combining these two careers and implementing them in areas such as data science.
